###  Personal: 

Born in the year 2000, I have been coding since age 14 üí™. I donot have any social handles as such. I read mostly non-fiction books. My interest lies in AI, Blockchain, software, economics, psychology, physics especially astronomy, and math.  I do read philosophy occassionally, mostly stoicism. 

I support cryptocurrencies and believe blockchain does help in the exchange of value in the digital economy. 

Big fan of the writings of Steven pinker, NN Taleb, and Yanis Varoufakis. I travel occasionally and giving thoughts on embracing digital nomad life üó∫Ô∏è.  I'm not boring, my girlfriend had me tested üòù.

I learn and unlearn and relearn. If something excites me I learn that at any cost.  (but sorry violin you are too hard, I might need a lifetime).

### Profesional:

I build applications that scale. I write clean, well-documented code üíª. I code mostly in java, python, and javascript. I recently started to follow [styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) by google. 

**Backend frameworks**: I have worked mostly in **[fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [spring](https://spring.io/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**, I have experience working in *Ruby on rails, Django, Flask, Flutter, and many other frameworks* as well. 

**Cloud**: Most of my experience in the past couple of years is in **AWS**. But I have worked with **GCP** as well. 

**ML Frameworks**: Tensorflow and Keras, have worked in Pytorch as well. 

**Blockchain**: I have worked with ETH, BTC, LTC, XRP, DOGE networks, web3, smart contracts. I can set up fast and full nodes. 

**Frontend**: Exploring Nuxt.js, but currently using react for frontend. 

**DB üíΩ **: For most of my coding life, I have experience working with Mysql, Postgres, and MongoDB. 

I have experieince setting up VMs, setup dns, setup api gateway to applications, have built custom plugins in lua for [Kong](https://konghq.com/).
