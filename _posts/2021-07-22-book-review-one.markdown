**My take on antifragile by NN Taleb**

If you haven't heard about Nassim Nicolas Taleb, you should read about him. He is very interesting, his writings however are a little harsh. controversial and complicated. His book antifragile is complicated but profound. This book talks about how the opposite of fragile is antifragile. Taleb talks about *via negativa* and other psychological concepts and baises. For example *via negative* the process of winning by not losing, giving an amazing example of chess players, they play to not lose. 

Taleb continues to talk about religion, stoicism, economics, trading and many other things including how we are prone to fragility. Since he was a trader turned mathematician, the author knows a lot about the odds. He talks a lot about probability. I'm excited to read the other books written by him. This is one of a jolly ride finishing the book. Do check that out - Antifragile by Nassim Nicolas Taleb.
