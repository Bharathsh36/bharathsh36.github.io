**Goddammit, it's super cool.**

Its easy to setup, easy to deploy to github pages as well.

Give a try yourself: [Jekyll Installation.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

This entire site is on top of jekyll, and this is a theme from [kross-jekyll](https://github.com/themefisher/kross-jekyll). 
Took only few hours to go up and running.

Thanks for reading.
